#### Developer Info
This iOS App is created by **Giordano Menegazzi**, an individual **iOS Developer** from the Netherlands. 

- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/giordano-menegazzi-35108012a/)


#### App Background
The App is uses the free [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en) API to get its data, this means prices may slighty be delayed. The App doesn't track or store any data about you or your device.
However the App uses Core Data to pesist your saved data, this is stored in your pesonal database on your device only! 

The App is designed to be as save as possible so it doesn't sync or store any real portfolio data, you simply fill in how much you have from a particular coin and the app then uses that amount and the current prices from CoinGecko, to calculate your portfolio values. 


If you got other suggestions for new features or found any bugs in the app please don't hesitate to contact me at <CryptofyApp@outlook.com>.




## I hope you enjoy the App!



Greetings,

**Giordano Menegazzi**
